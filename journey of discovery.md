This markdown file records my exploration of using python to develop Android apps, including kivy, beeware and Android Studio. \
It also includes problems I encountered when using beeware and the corresponding solutions, and some tricks of beeware, which seem basic but really confusing to me when I first started using beeware.

# Kivy
It can package your Python project. But I had some problems with it that I didn't solve.\
And it's been a few days since I tried kivy, so I can't remember the exact problems. Sorry about that.

# Beeware
Beeware is the tool that I solved all the problems for my needs and ended up using.
